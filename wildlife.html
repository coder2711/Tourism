There is a great scope for development in this sector. Wildlife Tourism involves interacting with the wild animals in their natural habitat through animal safaris, tours, photography or by observation. It also includes viewing of animals in wildlife parks, zoos and going on camel or elephant rides. <br><br>
                Some of the famous natural parks worth visiting are the Jim Corbett National Park for the tiger, Ranthambore National Park for tigers and birds, Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary for the Asiatic lions, Kaziranga National Park for the rhino and Bannerghatta Biological Park which houses a zoo, elephant sanctuary, tiger park and a butterfly park. <br><br>
